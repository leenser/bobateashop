## Template for Interleaved Minutes

*If you prefer to interleave minutes with agenda items, use formatting like this:*

**Agenda Item:** What features are we most proud of?

*Minutes (in italics or different color):*
*Team discussed pride in the three-interface architecture. [Name] highlighted the authentication system with Google OAuth and role-based access. [Name] emphasized the bilingual translation system with caching. [Name] mentioned accessibility features including dark mode and keyboard navigation. Consensus that the manager analytics dashboard with X-Report and Z-Report turned out better than expected.*

**Agenda Item:** Why did these work well?

*Minutes:*
*Team agreed that clear separation of concerns in the backend (routes/services/models) and frontend (pages/components/contexts) made features easier to implement. Early decision to use TypeScript caught many bugs during development. OAuth integration was smooth because we followed the official documentation closely.*
